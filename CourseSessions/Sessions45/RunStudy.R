# THESE ARE THE PROJECT PARAMETERS NEEDED TO GENERATE THE REPORT

# When running the case on a local computer, modify this in case you saved the case in a different directory

# type in the Console below help(getwd) and help(setwd) for more information

# Please ENTER the name of the file with the data used. The file should contain a matrix with one row per observation (e.g. person) and one column per attribute. THE NAME OF THIS MATRIX NEEDS TO BE ProjectData (otherwise you will need to replace the name of the ProjectData variable below with whatever your variable name is, which you can see in your Workspace window after you load your file)
datafile_name="Boats" # do not add .csv at the end! make sure the data are numeric!!!! check your file!
#datafile_name="Mall_Visits" # do not add .csv at the end! make sure the data are numeric!!!! check your file!

# Please use numbers, not column names! e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8

# "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid")

# DEFAULT is "Lloyd"

# Otherwise, when running on a server the application will be automatically available
